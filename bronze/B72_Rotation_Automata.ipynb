    "Problem $\\sf MOD_p$ can be classically solved by using no less than $\\sf p$ states.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have observed, the same problem can be solved by using a few quantum states in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the above given random strategy can be implemented more state efficiently (we discuss the basics of this technique in the next notebook) so that $ \\log \\mathsf{p} $ quantum states is enough to solve the problem with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we need at least logarithmic number of classical bits. On the other hand, we can use double logarithmic quantum bits. This is another exponential advantage of quantum computation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<i> One implementation issue for the quantum algorithm is to implement more and more precise rotations, i.e., implementing the rotation with angle $ \\frac{2\\pi}{p} $ may not be possible when $ p $ gets bigger and bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, a long sequence of rotations may require some error corrections, and each error correction solution can use new qubits.\n",
