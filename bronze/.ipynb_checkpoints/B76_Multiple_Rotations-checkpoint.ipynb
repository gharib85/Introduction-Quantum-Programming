    "For 16 rotations, we use 4 control qubits and 1 target qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each pair of control qubits, we use 1 auxiliray qubit. \n",
    "\n",
    "For 4 control qubits, we use two auxiliary qubits. \n",

    "Then, we use one more auxiliary qubit controlled by these two auxiliary qubits.\n",

    "So, we need 4 control + 1 target + 3 auxiliary = 8 total qubits."
