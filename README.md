# Introduction Guide for Quantum Programming :sparkles:

My solutions for Q-Drive Quantum Programming Assignments. These collection of notebooks designed to introduce the basics of quantum computation and quantum programming.

I will be maintaining this repository and add additional resources to go beyond the introductory material.

These notebooks are under license of QLatvia Software: http://qusoft.lu.lv/ 

Use `index_bronze` notebook to navigate around the files.

You can simply clone the repo and work on the jupyter notebooks by yourself.

Note: GitHub not yet supports rendering new Jupyter Notebook format so you might not see the rendered versions of notebooks on the GitHub repo.

## Library Dependencies: :electron:

 - Install `qiskit`
 - Install `numpy`
 - Install `matplotlib`


## How `bronze` (jupyter notebooks) structured::books:

- `Python review`: Review basic operations and libraries of Python3
- `Some linear algebra`: Linear algebra review (dot product, matrix and tensor products)
- `Probabilistic systems`: Probabilistic states, probabilistic operators, coin flipping game
- `Basics of quantum systems`: Quantum gates, Entanglement, Superposition, Superdense Coding, Qubits
- `Visualization of a (real-valued) qubit`: Visualize Qubits, Create and manipulate quantum states
- `Operations on (real-valued) qubits`: Reflection, Rotation, Quantum Teleportation, Rotation Automata
- `Grover's search algorithm`: Inversion About the Mean, Phase Kickback, Grover's Search: One Qubit Representation
